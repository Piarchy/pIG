# pIG

A fun little coding problem that is used as a teching tool, usually as a first programing task. 

Each turn you roll a die and add the total to your points. You can stop at any time and keep that total, or keep rolling. If you ever roll a 1 you lose all the points you accrued.

#### Example of the game:
